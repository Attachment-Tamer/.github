## 🚀 Overview
Attachment Tamer is a macOS utility that gives you **full control over email attachments** in Apple Mail. By default, Mail handles attachments in a way that often leads to messy displays, inline previews, or compatibility problems with recipients. Attachment Tamer fixes these issues by letting you customize **how attachments are displayed, sent, and stored**.  

With this tool, you can force attachments to appear as icons instead of inline previews, control MIME encoding, and ensure outgoing messages are compatible with Windows and Linux users. For professionals dealing with email-heavy workflows, it removes frustration and guarantees smoother communication.

## ℹ️ About (Deep Dive)
Apple Mail is powerful, but its attachment handling has long been a pain point for many users. **Inline image previews clutter messages**, and recipients on other platforms sometimes receive garbled or inaccessible attachments.  

Attachment Tamer addresses these problems by offering:  

- **Display Control**  
  Decide whether attachments appear inline or as icons, preventing messages from becoming hard to read.  

- **MIME & Encoding Management**  
  Choose how files are encoded for sending (Base64, AppleDouble, etc.), ensuring cross-platform compatibility.  

- **Compatibility Settings**  
  Send attachments in formats readable by Windows Outlook, Linux clients, and older email programs.  

- **User Preferences**  
  Set global or per-message preferences, so attachments are always displayed exactly the way you want.  

- **Reliability & Professionalism**  
  Eliminate embarrassing cases where recipients can’t open files or where messages become visually messy.  

Attachment Tamer transforms Apple Mail into a **more professional, reliable email client** by fixing its weakest link: attachment handling.
